My personal website
Project Name: 30MFF - Money
Project Description: what is the project, what is the overall concept and theme, and what kind of experience you were striving to create.
The project is to build a website that assimilates the cinema experience of getting a ticket to watch a film. (The navigation bar on the far left and the name/date of event coming on the right; a ticket being "torn apart" to see a film, etc.) I imitated the layout and design of the cinema tickets, and I was striving to create an experience that elicits nostalgia towards the film screenings with tickets and antique-ish vibe with the serif fonts.
Process: How did you go about implementing the concept.
I looked up different ideas on the web to create a layout I could code. I got to learn about the flex tool, and I also used inspection tools around my website to make sure I can best fit my divs and elements in the gridlines.
Reflection/Evaluation: This should bookend the initial concept and talk about whether your expectations and goals were met in the process of building the final working version.
The initial concept looked even closer to cinema tickets, but I soon realized that my initial idea was not appropriate for a web page, since it was too short in height, as it mimicked the cinema tickets even more than my final version. Moreover, I wanted to create an animation-like effect that actually tears apart a movie ticket, but that seemed very difficult at my level of underrstanding. I felt quite devastated trying to make something that was a step beyond what was covered in tutorial videos, but at the end I think I achieved my goals that was constantly reshaped during the coding process.
