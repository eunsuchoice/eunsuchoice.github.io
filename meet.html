              Eunsu Choi is an off-cycle senior student studying music at NYUAD.
              Her final semester of the undergraduate years is going to be the
              only time she is going to be financially sustainable. Along with
              the new falcon dirhams policy, every dirham is very precious to
              her at the moment. Absolutely in love with money, Eunsu stars in
              this film along with her peers to celebrate the connectivity and
              the universal appreciation of money.

              Cole Beasley is a computer science major and interactive media
              minor at NYUAD, obviously for the amount of money in these fields.
              Absolutely obsessed with money, Cole stars in this film as just
              another human connected to his peers with the shared principles
              of the glory of cash.

              Chinonyerem is a sophomore majoring in Computer Science and
              minoring in Interactive Media with one thing on her mind: money.
              She spends countless hours collecting the treasure and spends even
              more hours arranging the notes, polishing the coins, dusting off
              the cards. In her free time she dreams of money and its endless
              possibilities. She stars in this film alongside her like minded
              peers to celebrate what truly makes the world go round:  not love,
              not friends, not family, but money.
