      <h2>BTS: Our Most Important Prop for All, the 10 Dirham Bill </h2>
      <img src="images/bill.jpg" alt="10 dirham bill" class="center"/>
      <h2> How Cole got his 10 dirham bill </h2>
      <p> At the time of the film shoot on September 2nd of 2021, all members
        discussed about an item that we all had. Then we realized Cole was the
        only one without a 10 dirham bill. So Eunsu, who lives in A6C, ran all
        the way to Cole, who lives in A5C, to drop off a bill.
      </p>
      <h2> How Eunsu's running turned out </h2>
      <p> Then later, Eunsu found out that one of her friends Harry was Cole's
        suitemate, and Harry mentions that he in fact had a 10 dirham bill at
        the time, so Eunsu's running all the way was a useless..
      </p>
      <h2> Did Eunsu get back her money? </h2>
      <p> Eunsu DID, thankfully. However, it took some time. Initially, Eunsu
        and Cole messaged each other and made sure they meet outside A6C. Eunsu
        went outside A6C and bumped into her friend, and while she was casually
        chatting, Cole passed by with his skateboard and disappeared. 10 minutes
        later, Cole walks into A6C, and it turns out that he had mistaken A6B
        for A6C.
