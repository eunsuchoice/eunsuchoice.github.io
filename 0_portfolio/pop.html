				<h2>1st EP: Narratives of Nature</h2>
				<p>
					Nature is Eunsu Choi's first studio album as a singer-songwriter. To be released in 2024.
					<br><br>
					About "Coastline"
					<br>During the lethargic summer of my twenty-five, following my father's passing, I embarked on a beach trip with relatives. Despite initially seeming to swiftly rebound from the loss, my emotions fluctuated, rising and falling like the tide. While I deeply appreciated my relatives' support through the tough times, their constant complaints during the trip sometimes grated on me. Yet, as I gazed at the coastline, I was struck by the ceaseless motion of the sea. Despite its rhythmic ebb and flow, the shoreline's ever-changing contours painted a picture far from the static lines on my mental map. In reality, the coastline had never stopped moving even once. Perhaps trying to freeze the meandering coastline in a single image was an exercise in futility.
					<br><br>About "My Universe"
					<br>As the COVID-19 crisis started to subside, I found myself at a friend's wedding. Whatever happened afterward, seeing the stage filled with two lovers and their parents made me realize that the love, family dynamics, and encounters of those I thought I knew well were like undiscovered universes to me. It dawned on me that the greatest way to celebrate their love was to empower them to sing a song for their unique universe, in their own voices. Despite it being a duet meant for both a man and a woman, I sang it alone in the demo.
					<br><br>About "Dear Wind"
					<br>During my college years, amidst emotional turmoil while preparing my graduation project, I felt myself losing direction. It was then that I met the wife of a professor I hoped would play the protagonist in my work. Initially reluctant, she eventually accepted after hearing my story, believing the project could breathe new "wind" into her monotonous routine. The glint in her eyes as she spoke those words was a poignant melody to me.
