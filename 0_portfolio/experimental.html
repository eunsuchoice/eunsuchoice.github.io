				<h2>18 and 130: Re-examining the Shakespearean Sonnets with Words of Maya Angelou</h2>
				<p>
					Shakespearean sonnets, especially Sonnet 18 and 130 are considered canonical poems to study in literature.

					<br><br>Then there is Maya Angelou.

					<br><br>Maya Angelou’s “Phenomenal Woman” speaks of womanhood that stands firmly against the obsolete words of Shakespeare.

					<br><br>The pieces – 18 and 130 – both portray how Shakespeare’s and Angelou’s words react to each other in an integrated form.

			<p><strong>Sonnet 18, by William Shakespeare</strong>				
				<br>Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
				<br>Thou art more lovely and more temperate:
				<br>Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
				<br>And summer’s lease hath all too short a date;
				<br>Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
				<br>And often is his gold complexion dimm'd;
				<br>And every fair from fair sometime declines,
				<br>By chance or nature’s changing course untrimm'd;
				<br>But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
				<br>Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st;
				<br>Nor shall death brag thou wander’st in his shade,
				<br>When in eternal lines to time thou grow’st:
				  <br> So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,
				  <br> So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.

				<br><br><br>
				<strong>Sonnet 130, by William Shakespeare</strong>				
				<br>My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun;
				<br>Coral is far more red than her lips' red;
				<br>If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun;
				<br>If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head.
				<br>I have seen roses damasked, red and white,
				<br>But no such roses see I in her cheeks;
				<br>And in some perfumes is there more delight
				<br>Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks.
				<br>I love to hear her speak, yet well I know
				<br>That music hath a far more pleasing sound;
				<br>I grant I never saw a goddess go;
				<br>My mistress, when she walks, treads on the ground.
				<br>   And yet, by heaven, I think my love as rare
				<br>   As any she belied with false compare.

				<strong>Phenomenal Woman, by Maya Angelou</strong>	
				<br>Pretty women wonder where my secret lies.
				<br>I'm not cute or built to suit a fashion model's size
				<br>But when I start to tell them,
				<br>They think I'm telling lies.
				<br>I say,
				<br>It's in the reach of my arms
				<br>The span of my hips,
				<br>The stride of my step,
				<br>The curl of my lips.
				<br>I'm a woman
				<br>Phenomenally.
				<br>Phenomenal woman,
				<br>That's me.
<br>
				<br>I walk into a room
				<br>Just as cool as you please,
				<br>And to a man,
				<br>The fellows stand or
				<br>Fall down on their knees.
				<br>Then they swarm around me,
				<br>A hive of honey bees.
				<br>I say,
				<br>It's the fire in my eyes,
				<br>And the flash of my teeth,
				<br>The swing in my waist,
				<br>And the joy in my feet.
				<br>I'm a woman
				<br>Phenomenally.
				<br>Phenomenal woman,
				<br>That's me.
<br>
				<br>Men themselves have wondered
				<br>What they see in me.
				<br>They try so much
				<br>But they can't touch
				<br>My inner mystery.
				<br>When I try to show them
				<br>They say they still can't see.
				<br>I say,
				<br>It's in the arch of my back,
				<br>The sun of my smile,
				<br>The ride of my breasts,
				<br>The grace of my style.
				<br>I'm a woman
<br>
				<br>Phenomenally.
				<br>Phenomenal woman,
				<br>That's me.
<br>
				<br>Now you understand
				<br>Just why my head's not bowed.
				<br>I don't shout or jump about
				<br>Or have to talk real loud.
				<br>When you see me passing
				<br>It ought to make you proud.
				<br>I say,
				<br>It's in the click of my heels,
				<br>The bend of my hair,
				<br>the palm of my hand,
				<br>The need of my care,
				<br>'Cause I'm a woman
				<br>Phenomenally.
				<br>Phenomenal woman,
				<br>That's me.
